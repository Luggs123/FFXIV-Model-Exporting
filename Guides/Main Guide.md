Welcome to the main guide for exporting your FFXIV character into a 3D model! This part of the guide will cover what nearly every player model will require. Note that some characters may require additional steps that take place during this guide. Please browse through the Specialized Guides and find any that apply to you.

# Advisories
I *highly* recommend that you save extremely frequently. Not just normal saves, either; **save a new copy** every time you complete a major step in this process. Especially if this is your first time working with 3D content, you will likely find yourself making mistakes, worst of all towards the beginning. If you don't save often, you will find yourself starting over many times. So keep a folder full of saves of your project at all of its stages. Preferably keep them numbered, but as long as you can tell what step a given save is at, you should be fine. 

In general really, you should keep your project organized. This project requires many different programs with many different file types and save locations. You want it to be as intuitive as possible to find where everything is located. This can take the form of a document with vital information, or a well-laid-out folder that contains everything for your project.
