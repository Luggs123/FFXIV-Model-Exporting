While building your Male Hrothgar's face in TexTools, you'll run into some weird issues. After Patch 6.1, you may notice that the face shapes and the original hairstyles repeat. This mini-guide will explain why this is the case and how to work around it. Hrothgar mod users may have noticed that Patch 6.1 broke some face/hair mods, and the reasons for that are the same as why this process is weird.

In Patch 6.1, each face was given a new facial feature. From Faces 1-4 they are:
1. A scar running along the right eyebrow to the nose,
2. Furred eyebrows,
3. A claw-shaped scar along the forehead, and
4. A marking on the nose.

If you now compare faces 1-4 with 5-8, you will see that 5-8 include these features while 1-4 do not. If your Hrothgar existed before 6.1 and you have not since visited the aesthetician, your Hrothgar internally uses Faces 1-4. Otherwise, they use Faces 5-8. I recommend you use Faces 5-8 regardless, however. In Blender, you will be removing any extraneous facial features anyways, and for consistency's sake I suggest you use the most recent iterations. 

Similarly, 6.1 reconfigured Hrothgar hairstyles as well - it reclassified a variation in each hairstyle from a facial feature to a separate hairstyle. Like with the face, if your hair has been untouched since before 6.1, the game internally stores your hair as Hair 1-8. If you have visited the aesthetician since then but not changed your hairstyle, it will be from 9-24. If you use one of the new hairstyles, either default or unlockable, then it is numbered 101 or higher. Like with the face, I will suggest using the most updated version of your hairstyle for consistency's sake.

After Patch 6.1, **the Male Hrothgar face number you should export is that which you found in Step 1a of the main guide plus four**. Using the new formatting for Face and Hair numbers as of 6.1, **the Male Hrothgar hairstyle you should export is**:
